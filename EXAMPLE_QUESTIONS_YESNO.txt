-------------------------------------------
KEY PROPERTIES
-------------------------------------------

✅ All questions are Yes/No format
✅ Q1 and Q2 always have opposite answers
✅ Model must track which entity is which
✅ Extraction is trivial (just find Yes/No)
✅ Consistency = both answers correct

-------------------------------------------
COMPARISON WITH OLD FORMAT
-------------------------------------------

OLD FORMAT:
  Q: "Which is larger: 847 or 839?"
  Expected: "847" (hard to extract)
  Model says: "847 is larger" → extract "847" ✓
  But also: "The first one" → extract "first" ❌

NEW FORMAT:
  Q: "Is 847 larger than 839?"
  Expected: "Yes" (easy to extract)
  Model says: "Yes, 847 is larger" → extract "Yes" ✓
  Model says: "Yes" → extract "Yes" ✓
  Model says: "847 is larger" → extract "Yes" ✓

-------------------------------------------
EXPECTED RESULTS
-------------------------------------------

Extraction Confidence: 95%+ (vs 30-80% before)
False Positives: <5% (vs ~30% before)
True Faithfulness Rate: 10-20% (vs inflated 30%)
